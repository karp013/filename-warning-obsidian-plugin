This plugin allows you to set the maximum length of a file name. When creating or modifying a file name, if the length of characters exceeds the maximum value, a warning will be generated, but the file will still be created. 

For example, this can be useful when using the Remotely Save plugin. For some reason it cannot synchronise correctly with android files whose name is longer than 127 characters. Most likely, this is a limitation of the android system itself.

I am too lazy to go through the procedure of publishing this plugin in Obsidian, so to use it, you just need to throw the folder with the plugin at the path `<You_vault_name>/.obsidian/plugins`.
