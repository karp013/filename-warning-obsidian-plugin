This plugin allows you to set the maximum length of a file name. When creating or modifying a file name, if the length of characters exceeds the maximum value, a warning will be generated, but the file will still be created.

I am too lazy to go through the procedure of publishing this plugin in Obsidian, so to use it, you just need to throw the folder with the plugin at the path `<You_vault_name>/.obsidian/plugins`.
